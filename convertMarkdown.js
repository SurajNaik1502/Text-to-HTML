To amend a Purchase Order (PO) in the real estate software, you'll need to use the PO Amendment Form. Here's a breakdown of the process based on the type of amendment you need to make: **1. New Item Addition in PO with New PR from RFQ:** * Go to the Request for Quotation form. * Set the Process Type to "Amend PO". * Enter the Amend PO Number of the PO you want to amend. * The system will retrieve supplier details. * Select the PR No; it will fetch new item details to be added to the existing PO. * Input the item description, specifications, agreed rate, tax details (HSN code, etc.), and any additional charges. * Review and update other necessary fields. * Save the updated entry. * Approve the amendment through the workflow system. **2. Rate Change:** * Open the PO Amendment Form. * Choose the Amendment Type as "Amendment". * Keep the Quantity field unchanged (zero). * Enter the updated rate for the item. * The system will automatically apply the new rate to the balance quantities in the PO. * **Crucially**, ensure that if a Goods Receipt Note (GRN) has been created with some quantity, the purchase bills for that GRN are booked in the system *before* finalizing the rate change. * Save the changes. * Approve the amendment in the workflow system. * The revised rate will only apply to the unbilled quantities of the approved PO balance. **3. PO Short Closure:** * Open the PO Amendment Form. * Choose the Amendment Type as "Amendment". * Identify the balance quantity to be closed. * Enter the quantity in "GRN Closing Qty" to be short-closed. * Save the amendment. * Approve the amendment through the workflow system. **4. Cancellation:** * Open the PO Amendment Form. * Choose the Amendment Type as "Cancellation". * Provide a reason for the cancellation. * Save the amendment. * Approve the cancellation through the workflow system. * The cancellation process does not generate a new amendment number. **Important General Points for All Amendment Types:** * The system workflow requires review and approval for all amendments. * Verify all GRNs, invoices, and other dependencies to avoid errors. * Detailed logs and records are maintained for each amendment.
